# WordPress PHP Snippets
- Bolt on features without ever touching functions.php

A bunch of PHP snippets easily used by the [Code Snippets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets) plugin in WordPress.

Each file is a different snippet, some are specified to be used on Front-end only (more effcient), while some need to be used everywhere.
